Phase 1: Data Preparation (ODIR-5K) - COMPLETED & VERIFIED
- Extracted few-shot examples for PaliGemma from the ODIR-5K dataset.
- Saved examples to `few_shot_examples.json`.
- Verified image paths and diagnostic keywords by re-running `prepare_few_shot.py`.

Phase 2: Agent A (The Observer) - COMPLETED
- Implemented `agent_observer.py` using `keras_nlp` and `pali_gemma_3b_mix_224`.
- Configured model for `float16` precision to target low-resource deployment.
- Established `analyze_image` function for visual feature extraction.
- Integrated testing with Phase 1 data (`few_shot_examples.json`).
- ENHANCED: Updated `analyze_image` prompt to explicitly target Diabetic Retinopathy and Glaucoma ("detect signs of diabetic retinopathy and glaucoma...").
- ENHANCED: Added verification loops for both 'D' (Diabetic Retinopathy) and 'G' (Glaucoma) classes in the test stub.
