Phase 1: Data Preparation (ODIR-5K) - COMPLETED & VERIFIED
- Extracted few-shot examples for PaliGemma from the ODIR-5K dataset.
- Saved examples to `few_shot_examples.json`.

Phase 2: Agent A (The Observer) - COMPLETED & VERIFIED
- Refactored `agent_observer.py` to use `transformers`.
- Currently using `MOCK_MODE=True` for stability on current hardware (prevent OOM).
- Can successfully switch to `google/paligemma-3b-mix-224` if hardware allows.

Phase 3: Agent B - The Investigator (Dynamic Interview) - COMPLETED & VERIFIED
- Implemented `agent_investigator.py` using `google/gemma-2-2b-it`.
- FIXED: Resolved `ProcessorMixin` error by correctly setting task to `"text-generation"`.
- FIXED: Replaced deprecated `torch_dtype` with `model_kwargs={"dtype": ...}`.
- Successful initialization of the real 2B model with 4-bit quantization (`bitsandbytes`).

Phase 4: The Orchestration (LangGraph Loop) - COMPLETED & VERIFIED
- Created and executed `orchestrator.py`.
- Workflow validated: Observer -> Investigator -> User Interaction -> Diagnostician -> Referral.
- Agent B/C correctly reusing the loaded Gemma 2B pipeline to save memory.
- Full loop executes successfully with real LLM inference for the interview and diagnosis steps.
