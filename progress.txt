Phase 1: Data Preparation (ODIR-5K) - COMPLETED & VERIFIED
- Extracted few-shot examples for PaliGemma from the ODIR-5K dataset.
- Saved examples to `few_shot_examples.json`.
- Verified image paths and diagnostic keywords by re-running `prepare_few_shot.py`.

Phase 2: Agent A (The Observer) - COMPLETED (TRANSFORMERS MIGRATION)
- Refactored `agent_observer.py` to use `transformers` and `bitsandbytes` (4-bit quantization) to resolve Windows compatibility issues.
- Integrated `google/paligemma-3b-mix-224` from Hugging Face Hub.
- Authenticated with Hugging Face Token.
- Implemented `get_visual_findings` with `PaliGemmaProcessor` and `PaliGemmaForConditionalGeneration`.
- Status: Model is currently downloading (approx 11GB). Script handles CPU fallback if 4-bit CUDA fails.

Phase 3: Agent B - The Investigator (Dynamic Interview) - COMPLETED & VERIFIED
- Implemented `agent_investigator.py` using Hugging Face `transformers` pipeline.
- Model: `google/medgemma-1.5-4b-it` (4B parameters, bfloat16).
- Validated: Script successfully downloaded weights and generated a relevant follow-up clinical question based on dummy visual findings.
- Fallback: Includes logic to downgrade to smaller Gemma models if high-vram models fail in production.
