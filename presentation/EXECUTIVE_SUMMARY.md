# VisionLink: Executive Summary
## AI-Powered Rural Triage Agent for Ophthalmic Care

---

### 🎯 The Opportunity

**2.6 billion people** globally lack access to eye care specialists, with **80% of vision loss being preventable** through early detection. Rural populations face months-long wait times for specialist consultations, leading to irreversible blindness from treatable conditions like diabetic retinopathy.

---

### 💡 The Solution

**VisionLink** is an AI-powered triage system that brings specialist-level eye care to rural clinics through intelligent multi-agent orchestration. By combining vision-language models with medical reasoning, we automate the complete screening workflow:

1. **Visual Analysis** → PaliGemma analyzes retinal scans
2. **Clinical Interview** → MedGemma conducts dynamic patient questioning  
3. **Triage Decision** → Automated urgency classification and referral

### 🏗️ Technical Innovation

**Three-Agent Architecture**
- **Agent A (Observer)**: Extracts visual features from retinal scans
- **Agent B (Investigator)**: Asks targeted medical history questions
- **Agent C (Diagnostician)**: Synthesizes findings into triage reports

**Key Differentiators**
- ✅ **Dual-Architecture**: Available as instant serverless (Online) or air-gapped GPU (Offline)
- ✅ **Cyclic Reasoning**: Continues gathering information until confident
- ✅ **Interpretable**: Each agent's output is human-readable
- ✅ **Rural-Optimized**: Offline version runs on $1,500 consumer hardware via 4-bit quantization
